# Sentiment Web Crawler

This is a web crawler developed for the final project of the fall 2018 COMP 479 - Information Retrieval course in Concordia University. The goal of the project is to experiment with web crawling, while scraping and indexing web documents and associating sentiment values to the index.

We make use of the [afinn](https://pypi.org/project/afinn/) Python package to generate sentiment values, and [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) to scrape the web.

The start URL is the [about page](https://www.concordia.ca/about.html) of the Concordia University website.
